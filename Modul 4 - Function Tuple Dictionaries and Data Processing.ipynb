Dictionaries are unordered*, changeable (mutable), and indexed collections of data. (*In Python 3.6x dictionaries have become ordered by default.\n","\n","Each dictionary is a set of key : value pairs. You can create it by using the following syntax:\n","\n","```python            \n","myDictionary = {\n","    key1 : value1,\n","    key2 : value2,\n","    key3 : value3,\n","    }\n","```\n","2. If you want to access a dictionary item, you can do so by making a reference to its key inside a pair of square brackets (ex. 1) or by using the get() method (ex. 2):\n","\n","```python                                                                                         \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"kwiat\" : \"flower\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","item1 = polEngDict[\"gleba\"]    # ex. 1\n","print(item1)    # outputs: soil\n","\n","item2 = polEngDict.get(\"woda\")\n","print(item2)    # outputs: water\n","```\n","3. If you want to change the value associated with a specific key, you can do so by referring to the item's key name in the following way:\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"zamek\" : \"castle\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","polEngDict[\"zamek\"] = \"lock\"\n","item = polEngDict[\"zamek\"]    # outputs: lock\n","```\n","4. To add or remove a key (and the associated value), use the following syntax:\n","\n","```python \n","myPhonebook = {}    # an empty dictionary\n","\n","myPhonebook[\"Adam\"] = 3456783958    # create/add a key-value pair\n","print(myPhonebook)    # outputs: {'Adam': 3456783958}\n","\n","del myPhonebook[\"Adam\"]\n","print(myPhonebook)    # outputs: {}\n","```\n","\n","You can also insert an item to a dictionary by using the update() method, and remove the last element by using the popitem() method, e.g.:\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\"kwiat\" : \"flower\"}\n","\n","polEngDict = update(\"gleba\" : \"soil\")\n","print(polEngDict)    # outputs: {'kwiat' : 'flower', 'gleba' : 'soil'}\n","\n","polEngDict.popitem()\n","print(polEngDict)    # outputs: {'kwiat' : 'flower'}\n","```\n","\n","5. You can use the for loop to loop through a dictionary, e.g.:\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"zamek\" : \"castle\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","for item in polEngDict:\n","    print(item)    # outputs: zamek\n","                   #          woda\n","                   #          gleba\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","\n","6. If you want to loop through a dictionary's keys and values, you can use the items() method, e.g.:\n","\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"zamek\" : \"castle\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","for key, value in polEngDict.items():\n","    print(\"Pol/Eng ->\", key, \":\", value)\n","```\n","\n","\n","7. To check if a given key exists in a dictionary, you can use the in keyword:\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"zamek\" : \"castle\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","if \"zamek\" in polEngDict:\n","    print(\"Yes\")\n","else:\n","    print(\"No\")\n","```\n","\n","8. You can use the del keyword to remove a specific item, or delete a dictionary. To remove all the dictionary's items, you need to use the clear() method:\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"zamek\" : \"castle\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","print(len(polEngDict))    # outputs: 3\n","del polEngDict[\"zamek\"]    # remove an item\n","print(len(polEngDict))    # outputs: 2\n","\n","polEngDict.clear()   # removes all the items\n","print(len(polEngDict))    # outputs: 0\n","\n","del polEngDict    # removes the dictionary\n","```\n","\n","9. To copy a dictionary, use the copy() method:\n","\n","```python \n","polEngDict = {\n","    \"zamek\" : \"castle\",\n","    \"woda\"  : \"water\",\n","    \"gleba\" : \"soil\"\n","    }\n","\n","copyDict = polEngDict.copy()\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xuDfwwZTOuEG","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Project  - Tic Tac Toe\n","\n","Scenario\n","Your task is to write a simple program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with the user.

the number must be valid, i.e., it must be an integer, it must be greater than 0 and less than 10, and it cannot point to a field which is already occupied;\n","- the program checks if the game is over - there are four possible verdicts: the game should continue, or the game ends with a tie, your win, or the computer's win;\n","- the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated;\n","- don't implement any form of artificial intelligence -
